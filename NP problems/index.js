/*
	A problem is called NP (nondeterministic polynomial) 
    if its solution can be guessed and verified in polynomial time.

    There is no "easy" and fast way to solve NP problem, so
    approximation algorithms are used for NP problems

    Greedy algorithms are a good way for approximation

    Ex: Traveling Sales Person, Postman should find shortest path to deliver 20 mails
